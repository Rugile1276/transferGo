It was done with protractor (js) and jasme framework, tools that I am working with in my current position.
Even though protractor is for angular applications, I adjusted it to needed app.
I disabled waiting for protractr app and somewhere added protractor waiting for expected conditions(when working with angular app it's not needed)
